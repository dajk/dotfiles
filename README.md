# dotfiles

## Getting started (Install in OSX)

- ##### INSTALL GIT

First git installation is needed. Open `terminal` and run following command:

```sh
git
```

It's going to open confirmation popup with question if you want to install git, confirm it and you are good to go.

The next command will do the whole process, download the repo, install it and do the cleanup.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dajk/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && ~/dotfiles/install.sh && rm ~/dotfiles
```

- ##### ACTIVATING THEME

1. `iTerm2` > `Preferences` > `Profiles` > `Colors` Tab
2. Open the `Color Presets...` drop-down in the bottom right corner
3. Select `Import...` from the list
4. Select the `Dracula-theme.itermcolors` file (since the `install.sh` script is cleaning up the repo at the end, download theme from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dajk/dotfiles/master/iterm2/Dracula-theme.itermcolors) and select it in this step)
5. Select the `Dracula-theme` from `Color Presets...`

- ##### RUN DOCKER

```sh
open /Applications/Docker.app
```

- ##### RUN POSTGRESQL

```sh
pg_start
createdb
```
